# CS493: Cloud Application Development

CS493 focuses on **cloud computing** and **web API development**, two essential components of modern software engineering. The course emphasizes **RESTful API design**, **cloud infrastructure**, **security**, and **scalability**, preparing developers to build **real-world, cloud-hosted applications**. Students will engage with **first-party documentation** from cloud service providers and API platforms to navigate real-world development workflows.

## Key Topics
- **Cloud Computing**: Deploying and managing applications on distributed infrastructure.
- **RESTful API Design**: Structuring APIs using standard HTTP methods and principles.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implementing secure access controls for API resources.
- **Data Persistence & Storage**: Leveraging cloud databases and storage solutions.
- **Containerization & Deployment**: Using Docker and Google Cloud Platform for scalable application hosting.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handling API requests efficiently with queuing mechanisms.
- **Search & Indexing**: Integrating open-source indexing tools for optimized data retrieval.
- **Performance & Reliability**: Monitoring and evaluating API efficiency and uptime.

## Course Objectives
- **Develop RESTful APIs** that adhere to best practices and industry standards.
- **Implement authentication and authorization** mechanisms to protect API endpoints.
- **Utilize cloud-based storage solutions** for scalable data persistence.
- **Deploy containerized applications** using **Docker** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
- **Implement asynchronous request handling** for efficient API processing.
- **Optimize API performance** using monitoring tools and analytics.

## Technologies & Tools
| Category                 | Technologies Used |
|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Cloud Platform**      | Google Cloud Platform (GCP) |
| **Programming Languages** | Python 3 (Flask) / Node.js |
| **API Development**     | RESTful APIs, HTTP Methods |
| **Security**            | OAuth2, Token-based Authentication |
| **Containerization**    | Docker |
| **Database Management** | Cloud-based storage & indexing |
| **Testing & Debugging** | Postman |

## Course Approach
This course differs from traditional step-by-step instruction by **mimicking real-world software development workflows**. While foundational concepts are taught directly, most **technical implementation details are sourced from first-party documentation** (e.g., Google Cloud, OAuth standards). Students will be expected to **self-navigate API documentation**, perform **hands-on experimentation**, and use **external resources**—similar to what is expected in industry roles.

This repository will serve as a **portfolio of cloud-based applications**, culminating in a **final project** that integrates all learned concepts into a fully functional cloud API.
